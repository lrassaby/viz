There were several components that we implemented that were beyond the 
requirements for the assignment:
- Completed all additional requirements
- GUI for starting the project
- Very clean, modular code that makes developing a new transition relatively simple 
- Cool colors and generation based on the golden ratio, for maximal clarity
