There were several components that we implemented that were beyond the 
requirements for the assignment:
- GUI for starting a treemap
- Modular data structures that make developing a new treemap relatively simple 
- Color generation based on the golden ratio, for maximal clarity
- Concentric colored borders around hovering nodes
- "Change display fields" button in nonhierarchical treemap
- Support for any number of columns in a CSV file for the nonhierarchical and 
barchart treemap
